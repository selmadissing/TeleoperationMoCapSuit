R_3j6QI93Gqu0LFoB,1,24,3,1,2,4,1,2,2,2,4,4,1,2,4,1,1,3,2,"No inward rotation of the arms, The reaction times are a bit inconsistent so sometimes you may think the robot is not going to move but after a while it does. Not both sides(left and right) of the body move the same way. The same action does not always produce the same results on the bot",2,4,2,"I would like both sides of the body to behave similarly (left and right). The time it takes the bot to reproduce my movements is very inconsistent. It would be nice to have a feedback when the robot knows my position has changed and it is updating its own position (to know it got an input and it is processing something, so that I know to be patient and wait for it). I liked the setup (was very smooth). I like that the response is generally fast although the movements are often not too smooth. I assume the robot is trying to update the position of all it's parts very often. this is making it hard for it to keep up with the user. Maybe a solution could be to reduce the frequency at which the suit data is collected and then just infer the intermediate positions. This could increase the smoothness although latency may increase."

R_2Pv2St0W0HfyS5x,2,22,1,1,3,4,1,2,2,2,5,5,1,4,2,1,4,2,3,it is able to bend the elbow on the right arm but could not raise its arm. for the left arm it could raise its arm but not bend ,3,3,2,I liked how easily it moved its fingers 
R_2dPTOpDCQdO186v,1,21,3,2,4,5,2,4,5,2,5,5,2,2,4,2,2,4,3,no,3,2,2,the hand thing doesn't work. and sometimes it did not do the exact movements i made but some variaton of it.  The head works really wel. sometimes only one arm followed my movements. otherwise perfect
R_DCcYaYjepp0Iu1b,2,21,1,2,2,2,1,1,3,2,5,4,1,2,3,2,2,2,2,"The robots did not move its arms, however head motions were very good.",2,2,2,"Head movements were good and well timed, however the other movements with the rest of the robots body were not as well executed and also timing of the movement was delayed. the right arm of the robot barely moved, however the hands had some motion. However the problems with reaching amximum velocity were not the same as when using the other method."
