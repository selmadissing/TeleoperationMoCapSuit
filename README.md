## Content
This repository contains the code utilized in my thesis research, investigating the performance and usability of a motion-capture suit system in comparison to a 2D vision-based system for the teleoperation of humanoid robots, specifically the NAO robot. The code includes data collection, processing, and analysis scripts, along with the visualization tools employed to evaluate the performance of both systems.

## Usage 
Programming language: Python3 (recommended version is 3.7 or above) and Python2.7
<br>
<br>
Run both separately
- main.py for acquiring motion-capture data from Axis Neuron
- robot_joint_control.py in the "RobotJointControl" folder for the NAO robot
